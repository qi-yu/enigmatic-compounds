# Ad Hoc Compounds for Stance Detection

## 1. About 

This repository contains all data and code for the following (forthcoming) paper:

Qi Yu, Fabian Schlotterbeck, Hening Wang, Naomi Reichmann, Britta Stolterfoht, Regine Eckardt and Miriam Butt. Ad Hoc Compounds for Stance Detection. 
To appear in *Proceedings of the Joint Workshop on Multiword Expressions and Universal Dependencies (MWE-UD 2024)*.

**A short summary of the paper:**

We examine German ad hoc compounds that express attitudinal meaning of the speakers. 
While such compounds are crucial for stance detection, the state-of-the-art dependency parsers and
Universal Dependency treebanks struggle with parsing them. 
Through a corpus analysis and a psycholinguistic experiment, we verify that such compounds systematically convey attitudinal meaning. 
Furthermore, we report initial experiments with large language models that underline 
the difficulties in capturing attitudinal meanings conveyed by ad hoc compounds.
